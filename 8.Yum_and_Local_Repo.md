# Yum and RPM commands:

1. To install a package: yum install httpd  (To install a package from internet)
2. Using rpm command : rpm -ivh (package name) 
3. Remove package using rpm command : rpm -e (package name)
4. Uisng yum command : yum remove (package name)

# Major Update or Minor Update :

1. Major Update : 5 to 6, 6 to 7 or 7 to 8
2. Minor update : 7.2 to 7.3, 7.3 to 7.5 or 7.5 to 7.9

We should not do major update through yum command, but we can do the minor version through yum command by running yum update -y.

# Different between yum upgrade and yum update:

1. It Will update the package and keep the older version also in system : yum update
2. It doesn’t keep older version in system, It deletes the older version and installs a newer version. : yum upgrade

# Advance package management:

1. To install a package : yum install ksh* 
2. If package not available, Just search in google and download it using wget. and then install rpm -ivh (package name)
3. We can use the rpm -qi command to fetch the information about the package.
4. We can list out all packages in system: rpm -qa
5. Check the conf files of the packages: rpm -qc (package name)
6. How to check the full form of command: which ksh (it displays a output /usr/bin/ksh)
7. Command is belong which package: rpm -qf /usr/bin/ksh (This command will displays the ksh package name)

# Creating local Repository:

1. Mount a DVD in /media and then create a folder /localrepo in slash. 
2. Then copy the Packages Folder rpm’s into the /localrepo. Command is cp -rfv /media/Packages/* /localrepo
3. Go to the /etc/yum.repos.d/ and move it to another path (which means backup)
4. Then create a file in /etc/yum.repos.d/local.repo and put the below content.

[centos7]
name=centos7
baseurl=file:///localrepo
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

5. Before we execute these steps install the package: yum install createrepo*

2. Base OS is underlying operating system packages.  &  App stream is application related packagaes, Developers tools and databases.
3. All repositories under /etc/yum.repos.d/  and the defualt repo file is rehat.repo
4. First of all mount the ISO file in /mnt/myrepo/  after that cretae the two files Base.repo and Apps.repo inside the /etc/yum.repos.d/
5. Content of the Base.repo

[Base]

name=Base

baseurl=file:///mnt/myrepo/BaseOS

enabled=1

gpgcheck=0


6. content of the Apps.repo

[Apps]

name=Apps
