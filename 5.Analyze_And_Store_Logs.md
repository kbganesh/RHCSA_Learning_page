# Terms Explanations:

All log files falls under the /var/log directory only, We go inside to analyze logs.

Boot.log : which helps to find out errors while system booting, If we restarts a server it will overwrite a file.

chrony : Which helps to store whatever changes made in cron files.

cron : It stores all cron modifying and new cron entries.

maillog : Which uses to find out sendmail and postfix logs and we can analyze.

secure : Which helps to store unwanted login attempts and as well it stores all proper login attempts too.

messages : It uses to store all system level activities, An administrator look at this log only during an issue time.


# Date and Time Explanations:

We must maintain a proper time and it helps to analyze logs in future. Inlinux a service called chronyd and it uses to sync a proper time to client machines. Older service name is ntpd.

Date : Used to display the date and time.

timedatectl : Which displays all detailed information of time and date in system.

timedatectl --list-timezones : Which is used to display all time zones.

timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Kolkatta :Which sets IST time in linux server.

timedatectl set-time HH:MM:SS : Used to set time in machine.

timedatectl set-time `2021-08-18 20:15:50` : Set both time and date.

timedatectl set-ntp true : It used to sync time with ntp server, First we must configure ntp before this.


# Chronyd configuration in Client machine:

1. Need to install a package using : yum install chrony

2.  And then start a service and enable it . systemctl start chronyd & systemctl enable chronyd

3. And then enter into the conf file and add the line : /etc/chronyd.conf is a conf file and add the line server 8.8.8.8 for test purpose and restart a service.

4. And then run the command : chronyc   (It gets into the command mode and sources in that command line, It displays source list of a file.)

# Analyze servers and Get Report:

Redhat provided a web based tool and the name is cockpit.

If we have encounter any production issue , we can generate sos report and then send the report redhat to further anaylsis. Just run the command : “ sos repot” It will ask some details and takes some time and then send that file to redhat team for further analysis.

Cockpit is a web based to analyze the server performance through a web based tool, In redhat is it install by default but in 7 we must install. (Available for Centos, Ubuntu and Red hat)

Cockpit Configuration:

1. Yum install cockpit* ( For install)
2. Start and enable the service using systemctl. (systemctl status cockpit)
3. Type : 192.168.1.5:9090 To access the cockpit.
4. Login using the root password.
5. Bunch of options available to manage servers,so we can manage easily.
