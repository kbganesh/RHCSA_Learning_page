# Managing Network Security:

A wall prevent the spread of fire, When data moves in & out of a server those packet information's tested against firewall. Watchman, Bouncer, Shield and it ha set of rules who can enter and cannot.

Two types of firewall, One is hardware and another one is software.

Linux firewall name is firewalld it is running in systemctl. it has four details. Table, chain, Rules, Targets.

We should use either iptables or firwalld.

1. systemctl stop iptables ( to stop iptables)
2. systemctl disable iptables (disable the firewall)
3. Centos by default firewall is firewalld. 
4. Check rpm -qa|grep firewalld
5. firewall-cmd --list-all 
6. systemctl start firewalld & systemctl enble firewalld
7. firewall-cmd --get-services ( It displays predefined servcies)
8. firewall-cmd --reload ( To reload the firewall) 
9. firewall-cmd --get-zones ( To view the list of zones in our machine , 99% will use the public zone only) 
10. firewall-cmd --get-active-zones (All active zones)
11. firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all( Only list out the rules of public zone)
12. firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent ( To add the service) 13. Start the httpd and unmask the service using systemctl.
13. firewall-cmd --remove-sevice=http --permanent( To remmove the servcie)  
14. Firewall-cmd --reload ( To reload the firewall)


# Add the 3rd party Services:

1. /usr/lib/firewalld/services/allservices.xml or elase copy any file from that location and modify it for your new service add. 
2. Example lets consdier we are goinf to add a sap service in our firewall. 
3. Copy the ssh xml file and rename into sap.xml ( Short lline make the changes and Remove the description add your own and then change the port number into 32 because sap will run in 32)
4. Restart the firewalld using systemctl and run the get services to double check and then add the service sap using add service command.

# Add port number:

1. firewall-cmd --add-port=1110/tcp --permanent ( To add the port)
2. firwall-cmd--remove port =1110/tcp --permanent .

# Other Rules advanced:

1. Firewall-cmd --add-rich-rule=’rule family=”ipv4” source address=”192.168.0.25” reject’ : Reject packet from particular ip.
2. Firewall-cmd --add-icmp-block-inversion : Block the icmp block.
3. Host -t a www.fb.com : To find the ip address.
4. Firewall-cmd --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter OUTPUT 0 -d 31.13.71.36 -j DROP : To block the outgoing trafffic
