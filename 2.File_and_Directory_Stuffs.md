We can create files and directories by using vi, cp, mkdir and touch commands.

The below command helps to list directories and files reverse order timestamp.

```
ls -ltr
```
# File management commands: 

cp, mv, rm

# Folder management comamnds : 

mkdir , rmdir , rm -rf

# Folder Ownership:

Used to change the group of the file: chgrp <groupname> <filename> Ex : chgrp root bala

Used to change the owner of the file: chown <ownername> <filename> Ex: chown root bala

# inode: 

inode is a number for that particular file, For example, if we create a file in backend a inode number created for that file for hard disk understanding purpose.

command to check the inode number : ls -ltri <filename>  Ex: ls -ltri bala

# Softlink and hardlink:

softlink : softlink removed automatically if the original file gets removed.

Hardlink: Doesnâ€™t affect the hard link if the original file removed and modified also.

when we create a softlink the inode number deffer for both file and link.

# command to crate a softlink: 

ln -s /home/bala/hello ---- The command creates a file hello in your current directory and link points to the /home/bala/hello.

# command to create a hardlink : 

ln /home/bala/hello ----- The command creates a file hello in your current directory and you cannot see any link visually but when you write anything in the original file it affects in the linked file also.

# Input and output redirects :

Linux has three redirects:

1. Standard input(stdin) ------ it has file descriptor number as 0.
2. Standard output (stdout) ----- It has file descriptor number as 1.
3. Standard error (stderr) -----it has file descriptor number as 2.

>  --- Redirects output to a file.   >>  ---- Append a file.

stdin ---- 0 Input used when feeding a file content into a file.

stderr ----- Used to redirect outputs to another file, For ex if we ran a command ls /root from another user it shows permission denied error , So during that time we can redirects the output to another file.

Command: ls -l /root 2> error.txt

When tries to execute a telnet localhost command it shows 4 lines error but when use stderr redirection 2 lines of output will store in our error file only 2 lines of error only display to us

# Pipes: 

Which used to redirect the output from one commands to another. The another will run the using the output of existing command.  Ex. ls /etc|more
