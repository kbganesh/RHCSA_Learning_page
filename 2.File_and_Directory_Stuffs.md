We can create files and directories by using vi, cp, mkdir and touch commands.

The below command helps to list directories and files reverse order timestamp.

```
ls -ltr
```
# File management commands: 

cp, mv, rm

# Folder management comamnds : 

mkdir , rmdir , rm -rf

# Folder Ownership:

Used to change the group of the file: chgrp <groupname> <filename> Ex : chgrp root bala

Used to change the owner of the file: chown <ownername> <filename> Ex: chown root bala

# inode: 

inode is a number for that particular file, For example, if we create a file in backend a inode number created for that file for hard disk understanding purpose.

command to check the inode number : ls -ltri <filename>  Ex: ls -ltri bala

# Softlink and hardlink:

softlink : softlink removed automatically if the original file gets removed.

Hardlink: Doesn’t affect the hard link if the original file removed and modified also.

when we create a softlink the inode number deffer for both file and link.

# command to crate a softlink: 

ln -s /home/bala/hello ---- The command creates a file hello in your current directory and link points to the /home/bala/hello.

# command to create a hardlink : 

ln /home/bala/hello ----- The command creates a file hello in your current directory and you cannot see any link visually but when you write anything in the original file it affects in the linked file also.

# Input and output redirects:

Linux has three redirects

1. Standard input(stdin) ------ it has file descriptor number as 0.
2. Standard output (stdout) ----- It has file descriptor number as 1.
3. Standard error (stderr) -----it has file descriptor number as 2.

redirections : >  --- Redirects output to a file.   >>  ---- Append a file.

stdin ---- 0 Input used when feeding a file content into a file.

stderr ----- Used to redirect outputs to another file, For ex if we ran a command ls /root from another user it shows permission denied error , So during that time we can redirects the output to another file.

Command: ls -l /root 2> error.txt

When tries to execute a telnet localhost command it shows 4 lines error but when use stderr redirection 2 lines of output will store in our error file only 2 lines of error only display to us

# Pipes: 

Which used to redirect the output from one commands to another. The another will run the using the output of existing command.  Ex. ls /etc|more


# Three types help commands in linux.

1. Whatis command ------ it shows little description of a command. (Example: whatis ls)

2. Command --help ------  it shows long description of command usage. (Example: ls --help)

3. Man command  ----- it shows full manual of the particular command (Example : man ls)

# Vi Editor Commands:

vi is the most common file handling method in Linux distributions.

i --insert mode 

:wq --- Save and quit

double dd --Delete current line

x --- for remove a current letter.

u --- undo the changes  

r --- for replace a letter. 

o ---To add a new line bottom of current position.

a ---- moving to the next letter.

:1,$s/^/Title/g ---- Adding the word title in front of the all lines.

:1,$s/$/title/g ----- Adding the word title in end of the all lines.

:q! --- Without saving wxit the file

shift + g --- Move end of the file.

:5 ---- To go end of the file

# File Permission:

We can use the chmod command to change the file permission.

Example 1: chmod a-r bala -----It removes read permission for all the users.

Example 2 : chmod g+x bala --- It helps to give the execute permission for the group.

If a directory doesn’t have a executable permission, We cannot go inside a directory and it throws an error Permission denied, Due to that When we creating a directory by default it assigns a executable permission.

# File Ownership:

We can use the chown and chgrp commands to change the ownership and group of a file.

If a directory and file anything inside a particular user home directory , The user can do anything it doesn’t check the permission, Because all user home directory by default permission contains that the user can read,write and execute so it doesn’t double check the permission.

You can only change the ownership and group change command from root only, but for your home directory you can change by yourself.

Example 1: chown bala ganesh

Example 2: chgrp bala ganesh

Exmple 3: chown bala:bala ganesh
